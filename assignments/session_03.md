## Short Sketch #1 - Digital Output
Create an Arduino sketch for the ESP32-S3 Dev Board implementing digitalWrite(). Program the microcontroller to display distinct On/Off patterns for the LEDs over time.   

The Project Must Include:
- a circuit with at least 4 LEDs (don't forget to include current limiting resistors).
- declaration and use of at least 3 variables.
- use of at least two conditional [if / else] statements.
- use of delay() function.
- use of logical comparator in at least one conditional statement.
- must display at least 6 unique LED patterns.

Upload your completed Short Sketch Project Folder to your GitHub repo with the title "YourName_SS1" (mine would be "IanP_SS1") before the next class session.    
The arduino .ino file must be in a folder of the same name. For example, the arduino .ino file "IanP_SS1.ino" goes into a folder named "IanP_SS1".

Send me the the link to your GitHub repo (URL, not .git) via Discord if you have not already done so. This is where I will check for your completed work from now on.

### Familiarize yourself with:

* [ESP32-S3 Pin Layout Diagram](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Pokorny-MTEC2280_D01-Fall2026/blob/main/schematics/ESP32-S3_PinOut.pdf)

* [ESP32-S3 PinOut Explained](https://www.luisllamas.es/en/esp32-s3-hardware-details-pinout/)

* [Arduino Reference](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/)

### [Installing ESP-32 Support in Arduino IDE](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html): read instructions until "Windows - Manual Install" 

### If your ESP32 Board is not showing up as a Serial Comm Port...
Download & Install the latest [Silicon Labs Virtual COM Port Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/software-and-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads) for your operating system.   
Please reach out to me ASAP if you run into any issues.

_If your esp32 dev board keeps crashing, becomes completely unresponsive, or you are no longer able to upload any sketch to it, you can put it in Bootloader Mode:_   

**First, make sure you do not have 3V3 or 5V plugged directly into GND anywhere! This will cause the microcontroller to lock up and become unresponsive.**

_If this does nto resolve the issue, then..._

1. Unplug microUSB cable to power off board.
2. Hold down BOOT button.
3. Continue to hold down BOOT button, plug in microUSB cable to UART port.
4. Press RESET while still holding down BOOT.
5. Release RESET, then release BOOT. 
6. The board should now be ready for firmware upload. I recommend flashing a simple sketch such as a serial "hello world" test or LED blink to confirm normal operation.

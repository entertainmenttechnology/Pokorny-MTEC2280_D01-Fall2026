## SESSION 08

## SHORT SKETCH #4: DUE 11/4
Use (at least) 4 hardware sensors to control a P5.JS sketch. You may use any combination of buttons, potentiometers, photocell, or touch points as your sensor. The P5 sketch must include:
- use of sensor data (transmitted via UART) to control multiple elements of your P5 sketch.
- use of map() function
- use of data type conversion
- use of declared variables
- use of background()
- use of fill()
- at least four graphics primitives
- display window width: max of 1080, min of 400
- display window height: max of 720, min of 400

Feel free to use images, sound library, etc. The content is completely up to you, but it needs to be controlled by Serial UART from Microcontroller.

Upload your completed code (both arduino & p5.js) to your repo before the beginnning of next class session. Remember, the arduino .ino file must go in folder of same name, and the p5.js project must include its entire project folder and it contents.   
Have your project (both hardware and software aspects) ready to present at the next class critique.

REMEMBER to add the p5.webserial library to the "head" section of the index.html file in your p5.js project:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@gohai/p5.webserial@1/libraries/p5.webserial.js"></script>
```

### Familiarize yourself with:

* [P5.JS: Getting Started](https://p5js.org/tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/)    

* [P5.JS: Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)

* [P5.Webserial Library](https://github.com/gohai/p5.webserial)

* [Arduino: Serial.print()](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/communication/serial/print/)

* [Arduino: math functions such as constrain, abs, max, min](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/#functions)

* [JavaScript: Data Type Conversions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_type_conversion.asp)


### Download & Install (if you have not already):

* [Visual Studio CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), not "Visual Studio", and install the p5.js extension (instructions [here](https://p5js.org/tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/))
